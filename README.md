# MATH-316


## Description
This course provided an introduction to several important periods in the history of mathematics, including mathematics of Ancient Babylon, Mesopotamia, Greece, China and India, medieval Europe, the Middle East and the Renaissance; the development of geometry, algebra and calculus. The course demanded several presentations throughout the semester, my two favorate were on the topic of [Florence Nightingale diagrams](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/MATH-316/blob/main/Florence%20Nightingale%20Presentation.pdf), and the [history of approximating methods for pi](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/MATH-316/blob/main/Approximation%20Pi%20Presentation.pdf). My Florence Nightingale presentation culminated in a [simple dashboard demo](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/MATH-316/blob/main/Data%20Dashboard%20Demo.ipynb) built using plotly express and dash. My final presentation on the approximation of pi incorported a [convergence analysis of several 17th centeruy methods using matlab](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/MATH-316/tree/main/Final%20Presentation%20Convergence%20Analysis), as well as the classic [Monte Carlo method for approximating pi.](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/MATH-316/tree/main/Final%20Presentation%20Monte%20Carlo%20Demo)
